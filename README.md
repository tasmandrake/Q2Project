# JumpNote

[JumpNote](http://jumpnote.herokuapp.com/) is an application that lets you take notes while watching videos. Every note is timestamped so you can easily jump back to that moment when you made the note. Type along to lectures or live streams, then share those notes and videos with a classmate or friend.

First, create an account or log in to see your profile page where you will find any videos you have taken notes on, or that have been shared.

Your profile page allows you to search Youtube for videos, see videos you have already taken notes on, and see videos that other users have decided to share publicly.

Any notes you take are timestamped and tied to specific parts of the video, allowing you to quickly see that section of the video. While taking notes you are able to bold, italicize, highlight, change font size and change other options to style the notes as you want.  All the notes are saved automatically every time you create a new line.
